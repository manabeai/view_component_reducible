# view_component_reducible

![sample](doc/img/sample.png)

This sample shows state transitions and partial updates powered entirely by ViewComponent.

view_component_reducible brings reducer-based state transitions
to Rails ViewComponent, inspired by TEA (The Elm Architecture).

This is a server-driven, HTTP-based approach — no WebSocket required.
